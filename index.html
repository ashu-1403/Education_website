            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society,
                empathy, and complex vocational skills.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Transforming education system in India</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all
                rural children between the ages of 6–14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to
                report enrolment above 96%. India has maintained an average enrolment ratio of 95% for students in this
                age group from year 2007 to 2014. As an outcome the number of students in the age group 6–14 who are not
                enrolled in school has come down to 2.8% in the academic year 2018 (ASER 2018).[17] Another report from
                2013 stated that there were 229 million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural
                schools of India, from Class I to XII, representing an increase of 2.3 million students over 2002 total
                enrolment, and a 19% increase in girl's enrolment.[18] While quantitatively India is inching closer to
                universal education, the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run
                school system. While more than 95 per cent of children attend primary school, just 40 per cent of Indian
                adolescents attend secondary school (Grades 9–12). Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $2
                billion to education in India. Some of the reasons for the poor quality include absence of around 25% of
                teachers every day.[19] States of India have introduced tests and education assessment system to
                identify and improve such schools.[20] The Human Rights Measurement Initiative finds that India is
                achieving only 79.0% of what should be possible at its level of income for the right to education.[21]

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated
                in terms of what they can teach, in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any
                accredited educational institution) and all the other aspects of the operation. Hence, the
                differentiation between government schools and private schools can be misleading.[22] However, in a
                report by Geeta Gandhi Kingdon entitled: The Emptying of Public Schools and Growth of Private Schools in
                India, it is said that for sensible education-policy making, it is vital to take account of the various
                changing trends in the size of the private and public schooling sectors in India. Ignoring these trends
                involves the risk of poor policies/legislation, with adverse effects on children's education.[citation
                needed]

                In January 2019, India had over 900 universities and 40,000 colleges.[23] In India's higher education
                system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the
                historically disadvantaged Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. In
                universities, colleges, and similar institutions affiliated to the central government, there is a
                maximum 50% of reservations applicable to these disadvantaged groups, at the state level it can vary.
                Maharashtra had 73% reservation in 2014, which is the highest percentage of reservations in
                India.[24][25][26][27]
